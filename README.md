## Description
Created a weather dashboard that dynamically displays the weather outlook for multiple cities. On the left side of the page is a form where a user can input a city. When a user inputs a city, a button with that city's name will be created so that the user can easily go back to a previous city. On the right side of the page, the current weather is displayed at the top and a five day forecast is displayed at the bottom. The UV index is color coded based on the severity level.

## Usage Instructions
### To Search
Type in a city to the search bar and click enter or the search button. Once a city is searched successfully, when the page is reloaded, the weather conditions for the last city searched will be displayed. 
  
### Successful Search
If there is a successful search, the city searched will have the current weather conditions displayed at the top, a five day forecast display at the bottom, and a new city search button with the city name will be displayed under the search button. If the city search button is clicked, the weather conditions for that city will be displayed. 
  
### Unsuccessful Search
If a search is not successful, an error message will appear just above the current forecast for the last city searched. Type in a valid city to the search bar and the error message will disappear and the valid city's weather conditions will be shown.
